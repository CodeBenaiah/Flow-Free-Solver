# Flow-Free-Solver-Using-OpenCV
This project focuses on utilizing OpenCV to read a free flow maze board and applies a backtracking algorithm to determine and print the optimal solution for grid-based scenarios.

## Features
* Utilizes OpenCV to read the game, extracting relevant information for further processing.
* Implements the backtracking algorithm to systematically explore all possible paths within the grid.
* Effectively selects the optimal path to solve the grid-based scenarios.
* Provides a clear and concise solution by printing the determined path.

## How it Works
* The game is read using OpenCV, extracting necessary data for analysis.
* The backtracking algorithm is applied to systematically explore all potential paths.
* The algorithm intelligently selects the correct path by considering various factors.
* The solution is printed, providing a clear and concise representation of the correct path.
